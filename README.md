Node-RED node for running Ecovacs Deebot vacuum cleaner robots

This node uses the [ecovacs-deebot.js](https://github.com/mrbungle64/ecovacs-deebot.js) library.

## Usage

### Ecovacs account

First you have to configure the Ecovacs account:
- "Email / Ecovacs ID"
- "Password"
- "Country code" (see [here](https://github.com/mrbungle64/node-red-contrib-ecovacs-deebot/wiki/Country-codes) for a list of country codes)

### Available nodes

#### Ecovacs Deebot

Available options: 
- "Account" (Ecovacs account / email address)
- "Name" of the Device
- "Device number"
- "Connect on startup"
- "Enable output of simple events"

#### Deebot command

Available options:
- "Command" (e.g. `Start automatic cleaning`, `Retrieve battery state`)
- Command specific fields (e.g. `Map ID`, `Spot area ID`)

## Models

### Supported models

* Deebot 900/901
* Deebot OZMO 930

Please also check the [current list](https://github.com/mrbungle64/ecovacs-deebot.js#models) of models that should work with the [ecovacs-deebot.js](https://github.com/mrbungle64/ecovacs-deebot.js) library

## Installation

It is recommended to use version 12.x or 14.x of Node.js. The minimum required version is 12.x

This node uses the [node-canvas](https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas) library for some map-related functionality which may require the installation of some additional packages.

The installation of canvas is optional and not necessary for models without map functionality, but for full functional range please install the following packages.

For Debian-based Linux systems the following commands should be executed:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential libcairo2-dev libpango1.0-dev libjpeg-dev libgif-dev librsvg2-dev
```

Installation for canvas on alpine based systems (e.g. Node-RED docker container):
```bash
apk add --no-cache build-base g++ cairo-dev jpeg-dev pango-dev giflib-dev
```

A reboot might be necessary before executing the next command
```bash
sudo npm install canvas --unsafe-perm=true
```

For instructions for other systems visit https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas#compiling

## Known issues

* There's a strange behavior of the battery value on Deebot 900/901. It's very likely that this is a firmware bug
* "Edge" command does not work with Deebot U2 (starts auto clean instead)
* The cleaning log has an empty result on T9 series
* The combined map data object does not work with T9 series
